#GCD requirements
FSM representation of the algorithm, with meaningful state names and output control signals to
the datapath.
If you intend to optimize the resulting FSM, show it before and after the optimization.
• Sketch of the datapath module and how the control signals affect it.
• RTL implementation of the controller, datapath, and the top module that combines them
(gcd_controller.v, gcd_datapath.v, and gcd_top.v). Don’t limit yourself to these modules, create
as many sub-modules as you see fit.
• Simple testbench that checks the results for at least 2 sets of inputs.
